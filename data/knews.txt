Premier Li Keqiang urged more efforts to be put into optimizing the business environment several times in the past week.
At the teleconference on government function reform on June 13, Premier Li spoke highly of China’s performance in recent years to create favorable business environment. He said that the facilitation of doing business in China has obviously improved and the ease of doing business in China experienced a big jump in global ranking, especially in promoting entrepreneurship.
He added, however, that the country should still see the gaps and realize that China falls behind even many developing countries in this area and emphasized the role of the business environment in stimulating better productivity.
“China will strive to create a more favorable business environment to attract investments,” the Premier said during the Second Global Overseas Chinese Industry and Commerce Convention in Beijing on June 12.
At the State Council’s executive meeting on June 7, where it was decided to establish more demonstration bases for mass innovation and entrepreneurship, the Premier stressed the importance of providing a supportive environment, including a “hard and soft environment” for attracting both foreign investment and talent.
